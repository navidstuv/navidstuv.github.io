## Navid Alemi
I am an AI scientist with a strong focus on computational pathology and cancer research. I obtained my PhD from the University of Warwick. I received a scholarship award from the Alan Turing Institute under the Intel-ATI partnership to pursue my PhD. After completing my PhD, I joined Paige AI as an AI Scientist. There, from 2021 to 2023, I contributed AI algorithms for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. I am also a Visiting Researcher at the University of Leeds, where I am currently working on deep learning algorithms for immune sub-type classification in pathology gigapixel images. My innovative work in the field continues to advance within this role.
